soon:
install rbenv and ruby - instructions in devsetup.md
get obsws to control obs via a script
figure out which twitch integration library to use

later:
compose.yml to configure docker compose to run rails, gowaws, opentelemetry, postgres (likely using mobilis to kickstart, it's a lot of wiring)
